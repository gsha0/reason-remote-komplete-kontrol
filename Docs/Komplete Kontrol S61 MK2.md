# Komplete Kontrol S61 Mk2 - Installation Instructions

## Background

By default Propellerhead's Reason 10 only supports basic MIDI functionality for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol keyboards. You can play notes, use the pitch/mod wheel and other standard MIDI functionality.

If you want to control device parameters using the knobs/buttons on the keyboard you have to setup custom Remote Override Mappings. However even when doing this you essentially lock a specific hardware control to a device control which severely limits the number of device parameters you can control from hardware.

TODO - add installation/usage instructions
